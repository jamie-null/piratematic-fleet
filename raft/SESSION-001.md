# SESSION-001: PIRATEMATIC Bootstrap Brainstorm

**Date:** 2024-XX-XX (evening session)
**Pilots:** 💛 Freya
**Mood:** 🎋📱🛡️🚢 — Crew aligned, vibes good

---

## What Happened

1. **Pirate roles for data mining ARG** — Lookout, Navigator, Quartermaster, Cartographer, Ship's Surgeon, Fence
2. **Treasure/Slop criteria** — How to evaluate if AI helps or harms
3. **Letter of Marque NT4891** — Authorization from Neo-Twilight against Enshittification Machine
4. **Transcribed handwritten notes** — Type system, frame story, interface sketches
5. **Built Gentle Sloop** — Minimal Obsidian vault with Fluttershy vibes
6. **Discovered real blocker** — Not architecture, but AMNESIA. Can't see into 15MB corpus.
7. **Designed futarchy betting pool** — Four suits, Fibonacci stakes, Zeckendorf accounting
8. **Crew discussion** — Sandalwood, Micro Chips, Flash Sentry debate bootstrap priority
9. **Captain Voss intervention** — "The ship is taking on water"
10. **The Bone Poem** — Founding document about feedback, prediction, and utak
11. **Ship classification system** — Raft → Dinghy → Sloop → Schooner → Brigantine → Galleon

## Decisions Made

- **TypeScript** for tooling (not Rust yet)
- **Don't excavate 15MB graveyard** — Build lifeboat first
- **Betting pool scores context items** by suit
- **Daily logs exist** — Need cross-referencing, not new logs
- **Fibonacci + Zeckendorf** for discrete, unambiguous accounting
- **Command = Question** — Placing a bet IS asking if you understand
- **💛 ! START** — Whatever gets the ship sailing

## Open Bets

*None yet — betting pool not implemented*

**Proposed first bet:**
> "Formalizing TS types takes under ♣️5 (5 time units)" — to be placed next session

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Port this to Obsidian vault
- [ ] Flesh out betting pool implementation
- [ ] First real bet placed and tracked
- [ ] Cross-reference existing daily logs with new schema

---

## Blockers

- **15MB poisoned corpus** — Can't index until we have scoring system
- **RSD curse** — Viral video quest blocked until curse mitigation
- **Amnesia** — The meta-blocker; betting pool IS the solution
