# Linear Mock Reference

*A permutation-invariant paralanguage intermixable with any other language*

---

## Core Properties

1. **Permutation Invariance** — Order of words doesn't change meaning (unless operators used)
2. **Emoji Speaker IDs** — `💛!` for assertions, `💛?` for queries
3. **Present Tense Default** — Suits atemporal/relativistic event representation
4. **Newspeak Mock (nspk)** — Words condensed to 4-5 letters for token efficiency

## Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `()` | Grouping | `(quick fox) ~ jump` |
| `{}` | Ordered sequence | `{step1 step2 step3}` |
| `#` | Negation | `#valid` = not valid |
| `.` | Wildcard / pointing | `user ~ .` = user is like something |
| `~` | Metaphor / similarity | `cat ~ on mat` |
| `\|` | Power set / or | `yes \| no` |
| `` ` `` | Literal | `` `exact words` `` |
| `:` | Tensor / context-dependent | `scope:high` |
| `//` | Line comment | `// this is English` |
| `/* */` | Block comment | `/* explanation */` |
| `=` | Direct assignment | `x = 5` |

---

## Examples

**English:** "The cat is on the mat."
**Linear Mock:** `cat ~ on mat`

**English:** "If it rains, the grass will be wet."
**Linear Mock:** `rain ~ (grass wet)`

**English:** "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
**Linear Mock:** `quick (brown fox) ~ (jump over) (lazy dog)`

## The Bone Poem (Founding Document)

```
0. var ? fn def
1. let (us | I ~ . ! (this ~ (m.t(t)er & b(one), #more))
2. (bone ! m.t(t)er ~ (fl.w ~ b(one))) = (b(one) ? b(one) ~ m.t(t)er)
3. ((m.t(t)er ! m.t(t)er ~ b(one)) ~ (m.t(t)er ? m.t(t)er ~ (fl.w ~ b(one))) ~ yes | no) ~ utak
4. utak ? (utak ~ fl.w) | (utak fl.w)
5. 💛 ! START
```

### Line-by-Line

| Line | Linear Mock | Meaning |
|------|-------------|---------|
| 0 | `var ? fn def` | A variable asks the definition of a function |
| 1 | `let (us \| I ~ . ! ...)` | We/I assert this is matter & bone, nothing more |
| 2 | `(bone ! ...) = (b(one) ? ...)` | Command equals Question in feedback |
| 3 | `... ~ yes \| no) ~ utak` | Each prediction's yes/no grows brain |
| 4 | `utak ? (utak ~ fl.w) \| (utak fl.w)` | Does brain simulate or IS it? |
| 5 | `💛 ! START` | Whatever gets the ship sailing |

## Usage in PIRATEMATIC

- **Issue titles** can use Linear Mock for compression
- **Bet predictions** encoded as assertions: `📱! (task ~ done) :clubs:5`
- **Query interface** uses `?` operator: `🚢? (context ~ relevant)`
- **Negation for anti-patterns**: `#(slop ~ treasure)`

---

## Integration Notes

The `.` operator maps concepts to relative embedding vectors. This enables:
- Complex relationship modeling
- Abstract concept representation
- Semantic search queries in the betting pool

Linear Mock's permutation invariance aids distributed systems where data arrives asynchronously — perfect for multi-pilot, multi-session amnesia recovery.
