# 🦋 START HERE — Next Session

*Welcome back! You made it through the amnesia.*

---

## What You Built Last Session

✅ **Complete hybrid bootstrap** of the betting pool system

**11 new files created:**
- Setup guide for Obsidian Bases
- 3 fresh issue files with YAML frontmatter
- Comprehensive bet schema with examples
- Bet template for easy creation
- 3 real bets placed and tracked
- Complete workflow documentation
- Session log (SESSION-002.md)

---

## Your First Tasks This Session (Odd = Action)

**Priority 1: Create Your First Base** (♥️ ~3 units)

1. Open Obsidian in this vault
2. Follow `bases/SETUP_GUIDE.md`
3. Create the "🚧 Active Issues" Base
4. Verify your 3 issue files show up

**Priority 2: Resolve bet-002** (♥️ ~1 unit)

After creating the Base:
- How draining was it? (1-5 subjective units)
- Fill in the Resolution section of `bets/bet-002-base-attention.md`
- Change tags from `pending` to `resolved` and add `won` or `lost`

**Priority 3: Resolve bet-001** (♣️ ~1 unit)

Calculate elapsed time from session start (~02:49) to now:
- If under 60 minutes → won
- If over 60 minutes → lost
- Fill in Resolution section of `bets/bet-001-hybrid-bootstrap.md`

- `issue-PROBE-001`: Data Exploration (anchored/blocked)

---

## If You're Feeling Stuck (Even = Heart)

**"What should I work on?"**
→ Create the Base first. Everything else depends on seeing the system work.

**"This seems like a lot"**
→ Just do Priority 1. The Base is the MVP. Everything else can wait.

**"I don't remember the context"**
→ That's okay! That's literally why we built this. Read SESSION-002.md.

**"Did we finish the bootstrap?"**
→ Almost! We created the files. Now we need to USE them (create the Base).

---

## The Three Questions (Odd = Process)

Before starting work, answer these:

**1. What am I doing this session?**
→ Creating first Obsidian Base, resolving first bets

**2. What do I think will happen?**
→ (Already bet on this! Check bet-001 and bet-002)

**3. What will I track?**
→ Actual time spent, actual attention cost, whether Base works

---

## Success Criteria (Odd = Process)

This session is successful if:

- [x] You created at least one Base in Obsidian
- [x] You can see your issue files in the Base
- [x] You resolved at least one bet (bet-001 or bet-002)
- [x] You wrote SESSION-003.md (even if brief)
- [x] The boat is still floating

---

## Next Session Will Be About (Even = Planning)

**If Base creation went well:**
- Place new bets for next work
- Create additional Bases (Bets, Sessions)
- Start cross-referencing daily logs
- Pick next issue to work on

**If Base creation was rough:**
- Debug what went wrong
- Revise SETUP_GUIDE.md
- Adjust bet-002 to "lost" and learn
- Try simpler approach

---

## Emergency Procedures (Even = Safety)

**If Obsidian Bases don't work:**
- Don't panic
- Document what failed
- Fall back to manual file browsing
- The YAML frontmatter is still useful
- Bases are nice-to-have, not must-have

**If you're overwhelmed:**
- Skip the Bases for now
- Just read SESSION-002.md
- Place one small bet about next task
- Do that task
- Resolve the bet
- That's the core loop

**If RSD is high:**
- Take a break
- Remember: files want to be rewritten
- Nothing we built is precious
- The goal is learning, not perfection

---

## Remember (Even = Heart)

> "Does. The boat. Float."

The boat floats if:
- You remember more than you forgot
- You feel less stuck than before
- You can pick up where you left off
- The system serves you, not vice versa

**You've got this.** 🦋
