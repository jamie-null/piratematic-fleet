*Dump raw thoughts here. Triage later. No pressure.*

## From This Session

- [ ] ACE multi-agent system (Curator/Reflector/Generator) — from Gemini spec
- [ ] Zone-based partitioning for cliques (Shadowbolts vs Rainbooms)
- [ ] "Pay" mechanism — agents pay Bits for Curator passes
- [ ] Meta-awareness injection — hard sci-fi rules in playbook
- [ ] Evolutionary feedback — synthetic training data from corrections
- [ ] Delta contexts over monolithic rewrites

## Data Exploration

- [ ] 15MB corpus needs chunking strategy
- [ ] Some data intentionally poisoned — need adversarial parsing
- [ ] Graveyard diving is high ♥️ cost — schedule explicitly
- [ ] Dive requests should be tracked separately

## Lore / Worldbuilding

- [ ] Captain Klara Voss backstory — crashed in Z-space, sparkleballs at PRISM
- [ ] Zephyr Breeze (the ship) character sheet
- [ ] Ferret probe LSH / Ratty needs character file
- [ ] Toronto as home base — what does this mean?
- [ ] Umbrum + SCP Foundation corruption
- [ ] The magical curse causing RSD

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Schema for crew/character files
- [x] How do Bases integrate with this structure? → See WORKFLOW.md, property-first design
- [ ] JSON lines vs SQLite for bet storage → Recommendation: JSONL (see bet-schema.md)
- [ ] What's the actual token cost tracking mechanism? → Manual for now, agent later

## Open Questions

- [ ] What happens at zero bank in a suit? Bankruptcy or negative?
- [ ] How to flag poisoned/trap context items?
- [ ] Does betting history become memory? (Answer: yes, that's the whole point)
- [ ] Schooner class missing from fleet — intentional or oversight?
