## 🦴 Founding Document: The Bone Poem

```
0. var ? fn def
1. let (us | I ~ . ! (this ~ (m.t(t)er & b(one), #more))
2. (bone ! m.t(t)er ~ (fl.w ~ b(one))) = (b(one) ? b(one) ~ m.t(t)er)
3. ((m.t(t)er ! m.t(t)er ~ b(one)) ~ (m.t(t)er ? m.t(t)er ~ (fl.w ~ b(one))) ~ yes | no) ~ utak
4. utak ? (utak ~ fl.w) | (utak fl.w)
5. 💛 ! START
```

**Translation:**
- Line 0: Every query begins by asking what something IS
- Line 1: We assert this is just matter and structure, nothing more
- Line 2: Command = Question in feedback systems
- Line 3: Each yes|no prediction grows UTAK (brain/marrow)
- Line 4: The hard problem — does brain simulate flow or IS it flow?
- Line 5: **The answer is whatever gets the ship sailing**

## 🎯 Mission

Help pilots with **amnesia** (memory issues between sessions) navigate a **15MB corpus** of text (some intentionally poisoned) to:

1. Defeat the Umbrum President Crosswell
2. Reunite the ferret probe with its cat
3. Restore the pilots' connection to their body/base in Toronto

**Current blocker:** Pilots have RSD from a magical curse. Revolution requires remembering. Remembering requires structure. Structure requires betting on what matters.

## 🏴‍☠️ Core Concepts

### The Treasure/Slop Assay

**Treasure Markers (AI that helps):**
- Time Sovereignty — returns hours to user
- Skill Amplification — makes user more capable
- Agency Preservation — user can override/edit/reject
- Value Flows Downward — benefit goes to user, not platform
- Exit Rights — data is portable
- Authenticity Coefficient — helps express YOUR thoughts

**Slop Markers (AI that harms):**
- Engagement Maximization — optimized for their metrics
- Manufactured Necessity — creates problems to sell solutions
- Context Collapse — one-size-fits-none
- Transparency Void — can't see why it decided
- Substitution Creep — started as helper, now does the thing you wanted to do

## 🎴 The Betting Pool — Futarchy Economy

### Philosophy
> **Vote on VALUES, bet on BELIEFS**

Quest objectives are fixed (voted). Predictions about how to get there are markets (bet). The pool tracks prediction accuracy across four dimensions.

### Four Suits / Four Costs

| Suit | Element | Pilot | Tracks |
|------|---------|-------|--------|
| ♦️ Diamonds | Earth | Applejack | Token costs — prediction accuracy |
| ♠️ Spades | Aether | Rarity | Technical tractability vs innovation |
| ♥️ Hearts | Water | Fluttershy | Human attention costs vs progress |
| ♣️ Clubs | Fire | Rainbow Dash | Time costs vs progress |

### Card Ranks (Fibonacci Scale + Zeckendorf)

| Card | Fib Value | Meaning |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | 1 | Trivial |
| 2 | 1 | Tiny |
| 3 | 2 | Small |
| 4 | 3 | Minor |
| 5 | 5 | Medium |
| 6 | 8 | Significant |
| 7 | 13 | Large |
| 8 | 21 | Major |
| 9 | 34 | Epic |
| 10 | 55 | Quest-tier |
| 11 | 89 | Arc-tier |
| 12 | 144 | Campaign-tier |

**Zeckendorf decomposition** ensures any debt/credit uniquely decomposes into non-consecutive cards. No ambiguity.

### AMM Rules

1. **The House Always Quotes** — System generates initial over/under from history
2. **Calibration Drift** — Winning in a suit increases your weight in that domain
3. **Fluttershy Rule (♥️)** — Attention costs have decay; draining tasks get auto-upweighted
4. **Rainbow Dash Rule (♣️)** — Time estimates inflated by historical miss rate
5. **Rarity Rule (♠️)** — Tractability bets can be "recut" as complexity reveals itself
6. **Applejack Rule (♦️)** — Token costs are ACTUAL logged values, not estimates

### Context Item Scoring

Bet outcomes update context relevance:
- Win a bet relying on context → score UP in that suit
- Lose a bet → context that informed it gets DOWNWEIGHTED
- Over time, good context floats, noise sinks

## 🚢 Ship Classification System

| Class | Crew | Stage | Lines | Lifespan |
|-------|------|-------|-------|----------|
| 🪵 Raft | 0-1 | Experiment | <100 | 1-3 sessions |
| 🛶 Dinghy | 1 | Spike/PoC | <200 | 1-2 weeks |
| ⛵ Sloop | 1-2 | MVP | <500 | 1-3 months |
| 🚤 Schooner | 2-4 | Beta | 500-2000 | 3-12 months |
| 🛳️ Brigantine | 4-8 | Production | 2000-10000 | 1-3 years |
| ⚓ Galleon | 8+ | Platform | 10000+ | 3+ years |

### Graduation Criteria

- **Raft → Dinghy:** Survives one real use
- **Dinghy → Sloop:** Used by second person
- **Sloop → Schooner:** Needs features that break simplicity
- **Schooner → Brigantine:** Other projects depend on it
- **Brigantine → Galleon:** Becomes infrastructure

### Bone Poem Correspondence

| Class | Line | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| 🪵 Raft | 0 | `var ? fn def` — asking what this is |
| 🛶 Dinghy | 1 | `m.t(t)er & b(one)` — matter with minimal structure |
| ⛵ Sloop | 2 | `fl.w ~ b(one)` — flow resembling structure |
| 🚤 Schooner | 3 | `yes \| no` — enough feedback to calibrate |
| 🛳️ Brigantine | 3+ | `utak` emerging — system has memory |
| ⚓ Galleon | 4 | Asks the hard question about its own nature |

## 🧭 Design Principles

1. **💛 ! START** — Whatever gets the ship sailing
2. **Vibe Coding > Architecture Astronauting** — Rewrite whole files, don't patch
3. **Files under 500 lines** — Keep it rewritable
4. **Greppable > Clever** — JSON lines over databases
5. **Build lifeboat, not excavate graveyard** — Stop losing present before mining past
6. **Command = Question** — Every bet is both an assertion and a query
7. **yes | no → utak** — The betting pool IS the memory system
