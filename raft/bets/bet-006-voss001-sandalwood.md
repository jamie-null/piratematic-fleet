| ♠️ | 4 | 3 | **Under 3** complexity |
| ♥️ | 6 | 8 | **Over 5** attention (significant) |
| ♣️ | 6 | 8 | **Over 5** time (significant) |

**Primary bet (this file):** ♥️6 — Attention cost higher than expected

## Reasoning (Sandalwood Voice)

Okay okay okay, I hear what everyone's saying about "AMM logic is complex" and "edge cases" but like... y'all are overthinking this, AND underestimating how long it'll actually take. Let me break it down:

**♦️ Who even cares about tokens?** This is basically nothing. **1 unit.** We're not running a crypto mining operation here.

**♠️ The math isn't that hard.** Seriously! We've got good vibes, we're in flow, the design is solid. It's **3 complexity units**. Medium at most. Why?

Because **funny enough, the vibes counteract the trickyness!** When you're having fun solving a puzzle, the complexity doesn't feel as heavy. It's not about fancy math, it's about the quest with your buds.

**BUT...**

**♥️ This will be more draining than you think.** Not because it's hard, but because **attention costs compound over time**. You think "oh it's fun" but three hours in, you're still debugging calibration factors, and suddenly it's not fun anymore. **8 attention units.**

**♣️ Time sink is REAL.** Y'all are saying "5 time units" like implementation is quick once design is done. Nah. There's always "just one more thing." Always. **8 time units.** It's gonna take longer than we think.

**My whole point:** Micro and Flash are focused on complexity. I'm saying TIME and ATTENTION are what'll get us. But the good news? The vibes are so good that we'll power through anyway.

## Stakes

**Primary:** ♥️6 (8 Fibonacci attention units)

**If this bet wins:**
- I was right about the time sink
- We learn to budget attention better
- Next time we account for "fun turns into grind"

**If this bet loses:**
- It was actually less draining than I thought (awesome!)
- The "vibes counteract complexity" thesis was STRONG
