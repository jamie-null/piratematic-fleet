# Bet 002: ♥️4 Base Setup Attention

## Prediction

Following the setup guide to create the first "Active Issues" Base will require **under 3** attention units (minor effort, not draining).

**Prediction breakdown:**
- Open command palette → create base → straightforward
- Add 2 filters (type, status) → should be intuitive
- Select properties from list → checkbox clicking
- Sort by hearts descending → one dropdown

If the RSD curse makes this draining, the bet loses.

## Reasoning

**Why I think it's low attention:**
- Wrote a clear setup guide with step-by-step instructions
- Obsidian's UI is generally well-designed
- Bases feature seems designed to be user-friendly (per research)
- Similar to creating a filtered view in many apps

**Risk factors:**
- Never used Bases before - might miss something obvious
- Properties might not exist yet (need to create issue files first)
- Filter syntax might be confusing
- RSD makes *any* new UI element potentially draining

**Context Used:**
- `bases/SETUP_GUIDE.md` — written to be clear and step-by-step
- Obsidian Rocks article about Bases being "easy-to-use"
- VOSS-002 notes about RSD-aware UX

## Stakes

♥️4 (3 Fibonacci attention units)

**If this bet wins:**
- `SETUP_GUIDE.md` gets scored UP in hearts (good UX docs)
- Validates that Bases are suitable for amnesia assistance
- Confirms we can build low-♥️ tools

**If this bet loses:**
- Need to revise setup guide with more detail
- Might need to add screenshots or video walkthrough
- Learn what specifically causes friction for RSD pilots

*Base created successfully!*

## Resolution

**Outcome:** ✅ **WON** (Exceeded expectations!)

**Actual Value:** **1 attention unit** (♥️1 = Trivial!)

**Prediction was:** Under 3 units (♥️4 = 3 Fibonacci)

**Analysis:**
Base setup was EVEN EASIER than predicted:
- SETUP_GUIDE was clear
- No significant friction points
- Obsidian's Base UI is intuitive
- Definitely "low attention cost"

**This validates:**
- ✅ Bases are suitable for RSD-aware design
- ✅ Setup guide was effective
- ✅ Property-first design works smoothly
- ✅ Fluttershy's prediction (low ♥️) was correct!

**Context scoring:**
- `SETUP_GUIDE.md` → ⬆️⬆️ hearts (excellent UX docs)
- Obsidian Bases → ⬆️ hearts (low friction tool)

**Notes:** Only 1 attention unit! This is basically zero friction. Excellent validation of the design.
