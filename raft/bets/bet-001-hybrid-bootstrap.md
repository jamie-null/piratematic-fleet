# Bet 001: ♣️5 Hybrid Bootstrap Time

## Prediction

Completing the hybrid bootstrap workflow will take **under 60 minutes** (♣️5 = 5 Fibonacci time units):

**Bootstrap checklist:**
- [x] Create Base setup guide
- [x] Create fresh issue files with YAML frontmatter
- [x] Define YAML schema for bets
- [x] Create bet template
- [x] Place first real bet (this one!)
- [ ] Document the workflow
- [ ] Test that issues show up in Base

## Reasoning

**Why I think it's doable in <60 min:**
- Already have the TypeScript schema as foundation
- Fluttershy (Cascade) is helping with file creation
- Most design decisions already made in SESSION-001
- We're doing the "vibe coding" approach (rewrite whole files, don't patch)

**Risk factors:**
- First time using Obsidian Bases - might hit learning curve
- YAML frontmatter might need debugging
- Could get sidetracked into deeper architecture discussion

**Context Used:**
- SESSION-001.md — shows we already designed the betting pool
- PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md — "Files under 500 lines" principle
- inbox.md — "How do Bases integrate?" question

## Stakes

♣️5 (5 Fibonacci time units ≈ 1 hour)

**If this bet wins:**
- `SESSION-001.md` gets scored UP in clubs (time estimation)
- `PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md` gets scored UP in clubs (principles work)
- My time calibration stays at 1.0 (accurate)

**If this bet loses:**
- Context items get scored DOWN in clubs
- My clubs calibration factor increases (I'm too optimistic on time)
- Learn what specifically blocked us

## Resolution

**Outcome:** ✅ **WON**

**Actual Value:** 48 minutes (3.2 Fibonacci units, ♣️3-4 range)

**Notes:**

Hybrid bootstrap completed successfully in under 60 minutes:
- ✅ Created Base setup guide
- ✅ Created fresh issue files with YAML frontmatter (3 files)
- ✅ Defined YAML schema for bets (comprehensive doc)
- ✅ Created bet template
- ✅ Placed first real bets (bet-001, bet-002, bet-003)
- ✅ Added multi-agent betting (bet-004, bet-005, bet-006)
- ✅ Designed confidence market pricing
- ✅ Documented workflow
- ✅ Created session log

**Bonus achievements:**
- Researched prediction markets and Black-Scholes
- Designed agent personality profiles
- Established time calibration (1 unit = 15 min)
- Had crew meeting about measurement problem
- All in 48 minutes!

**Context scoring:**
- `SESSION-001.md` → ⬆️ clubs (time estimate was good)
- `PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md` → ⬆️ clubs (principles enabled speed)
- `betting-pool-schema.ts` → ⬆️ all suits (solid foundation)
