## Predictions (All Four Suits)

| Suit | Card | Fib | Prediction |
|------|------|-----|------------|
| ♦️ | 3 | 2 | **Under 2** tokens (cheap) |
| ♠️ | 6 | 8 | **Exactly 8** complexity |
| ♥️ | 5 | 5 | **Under 5** attention |
| ♣️ | 5 | 5 | **Under 5** time |

**Primary bet (this file):** ♠️6 — AMM logic is significant complexity

## Reasoning (Micro Chips Voice)

Look, I know what the schema says. "Automated Market Maker logic." That's a fancy way of saying "we're going to hit edge cases we didn't think of."

**But here's the thing:**

**♦️ Tokens are CHEAP right now.** Claude's getting better, context windows are huge, we're not worried about a few thousand tokens. This is basically free. **2 units max.**

**♠️ AMM logic is genuinely tricky.** Calibration drift, learning rates, Zeckendorf decomposition edge cases... yeah, this is **8 complexity units**. But that's OKAY because:

**♥️ Trial-and-error will be fun.** We're not building a nuclear reactor here. We can experiment, break things, fix them. The feedback loop is tight. **5 attention units** — significant but not draining.

**♣️ Same timeline as Claude.** **5 time units.** Bootstrap conversation already did most of the design work. Implementation is just making it real.

**Key insight:** I think tokens are cheap, complexity is real but manageable, and the fun factor counteracts the challenge. We're in a good spot.

## Stakes

**Primary:** ♠️6 (8 Fibonacci complexity units)

**If this bet wins:**
- Validates that AMM logic has the hidden gotchas I expected
- Proves trial-and-error approach works for this complexity level
- `betting-pool-schema.ts` scores UP in spades

**If this bet loses:**
- Either I overestimated complexity (good!)
- Or I underestimated it (learn about what made it harder)
