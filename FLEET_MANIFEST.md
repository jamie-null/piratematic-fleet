## Bone Poem Correspondence

| Class | Line | State |
|-------|------|-------|
| 🪵 Raft | 0 | `var ? fn def` — asking what this is |
| 🛶 Dinghy | 1 | `m.t(t)er & b(one)` — matter with minimal structure |
| ⛵ Sloop | 2 | `fl.w ~ b(one)` — flow resembling structure |
| 🚤 Schooner | 3 | `yes \| no` — enough feedback to calibrate |
| 🛳️ Brigantine | 3+ | `utak` emerging — system has memory |
| ⚓ Galleon | 4 | Asks the hard question about its own nature |
