# 🦋 The Gentle Sloop

*A tiny boat for tiny voyages*

---

Oh, hello! Welcome aboard. This is a very small ship — just a sloop really — but she floats and that's what matters.

## What Goes Here

MVP systems that actually work end-to-end:
- Works for ONE use case
- Has a schema or types file
- README has install + usage
- Can be rewritten entirely in one session
- <500 lines of core logic

## Graduation

**→ Schooner:** When it needs features that break simplicity

## Current Vessels

### sloop-gentle-vault
The original Obsidian vault bootstrap:
- `schema.md` — Rust-style enums for issue tracking
- `inbox.md` — Dump thoughts here
- `issues/` — One file per issue
- `templates/` — Copy-paste starters

### sloop-betting-pool (planned)
The futarchy economy:
- Place bets on predictions
- Resolve outcomes
- Track calibration per pilot per suit
- Score context items

## Philosophy

*"If you need more fields... just add them here and rewrite your issues. The old ones don't have to match perfectly. We'll be gentle with them."*

### The Rewrite Rule
If a file is under 500 lines, you can ask an LLM to rewrite it completely when the schema changes. This is faster and safer than surgical edits. Design for this.

### The Grow Rule  
Start with less than you think you need. Add fields when you *actually* need them, not when you *might* need them.
