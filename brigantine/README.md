# 🛳️ Brigantine — Production Systems

*Weathering storms*

---

## What Goes Here

Serious vessels ready for rough seas:
- Semver versioning
- CI/CD pipeline
- Actual documentation (not just README)
- Error handling that isn't just console.log
- Multiple modules, clear boundaries
- 2000-10000 lines
- Other repos import from this

## Graduation

**→ Galleon:** When it becomes infrastructure others build on

## Planned Vessels

### brigantine-lsh-port
**THE QUEST** — Port the LSH system from its unusual computational substrate to conventional computing.

Status: **Drydock** — Currently blocked by amnesia issues. This is why we're building PIRATEMATIC in the first place.

### brigantine-piratematic-core
The unified betting pool + context scoring + session management system.

Status: **Not started** — Will emerge from successful sloops

## Standards for Brigantines

1. **Versioning:** Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
2. **Tests:** Coverage on critical paths
3. **Docs:** Separate from README, actual documentation
4. **Config:** External config file, not hardcoded
5. **Errors:** Proper error types, not string messages
6. **Logging:** Structured, configurable levels
7. **Types:** Full TypeScript strict mode or Rust

*These are the ships we're building toward. The sloops are practice.*

**💛 ! START** (when a sloop graduates)
