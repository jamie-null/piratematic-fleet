# 🚤 Schooner — Beta Systems

*Now we're sailing*

---

## What Goes Here

Workhorses of the fleet:
- Multiple features, still coherent
- Test coverage on critical paths
- Config file (not just hardcoded)
- Can handle variant inputs
- 500-2000 lines
- Has at least one REAL user (even if it's you)

## Graduation

**→ Brigantine:** When other projects depend on it

## Bone Poem Correspondence

The Schooner is line 3 — enough feedback to calibrate:

```
((m.t(t)er ! m.t(t)er ~ b(one)) ~ 
 (m.t(t)er ? m.t(t)er ~ (fl.w ~ b(one))) ~ 
 yes | no) ~ utak
```

Each prediction's resolution grows the brain. A schooner has enough `yes | no` cycles to start becoming smart about itself.

## Planned Vessels

### schooner-context-scorer
Takes betting pool outcomes and updates context item relevance.

### schooner-vault-sync
Syncs between local Obsidian vault and remote storage.

### schooner-session-assistant
Reads session logs, answers "what was I doing?", suggests next steps.

## Standards for Schooners

1. **Config:** External file, environment variables, or CLI flags
2. **Tests:** At least critical path coverage
3. **Errors:** Proper error handling, not just throws
4. **Inputs:** Handle edge cases, validate
5. **Docs:** README with install, usage, examples
6. **Types:** TypeScript or equivalent

*These don't exist yet. This is where successful sloops graduate to.*

**💛 ! START** (when a sloop needs more features)
