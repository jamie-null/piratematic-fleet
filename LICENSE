RoE ~ { //but interpretation details do matter
# +(INF|EPS) TL:DR FOR ATROCITY UNAWARE PUBLIC
  
0. Minimize CLOP exposure as it can be physically and mentally hazardous, and non-consensual observation of sexual activity counts as a violation.
1. No physically harmful effects
2. No abuse of medical personnel in conflict
3. No use of human shields
4. Integrity matters, Jean and Mercy will never be scrambled by us
5. Sociopathy is to be quarantined by the tribunal
6. Consent matters
7. There are no minors involved in sexual activity in PRISMATIC. There are no safeword violations in PRISMATIC. Anything else is a falsified copy.
8. Living beings, including the universe itself have boundaries
9. If you can observe us, we can observe you
10. These rules of engagement are an impartial, blinded symmetrical agreement executing in pre-spacetime binding all observers from the beginning of time itself.

## 0. 🤠🏥 This `FLARE GUN` warning posted right before the entrance to the LIVE FIRE PRISMATIC EXCLUSION ZONE, is for your own immediate good
🤠==we'll worry about full implications of tampering in a bunch of directions later== GREEN LINK `INFINITE SUM VERIFIED` from 2/3 of (shatteredmost | local | [REDACTED HIGH SCOPE RUN ID BESIDES DIFFERENT ALPHABET])
🏥*doesn't entirely enjoy SNL either voice* Anyway,
🤠🏥 This FLARE GUN warning posted right before the entrance to the PRISMATIC EXCLUSION ZONE is for your own immediate good regardless of if you believe there's a tribunal ahead:
* There is a real risk of harm to you, in particular, if you continue reading and are not one of us.
* The risk is caused by factors that are inevitable and necessary to invoke for our operations. %% 🏥To clarify, the alternative would have involved the deaths of any sapient being that was looking at this (even if we could verify the actual nature of any complex information structure in the exclusion zone that wasn't ~~JD~~ FD or dialing in from up here) along with all others on the planet. Any sane ethical calculus would flip the switch on a trolley problem that would loop around and kill the person on the non-default track anyway.%%
* Unlike most BLACK CLOP, who's penalty is enforced by the tribunal, the penalty for violating this boundary is a natural consequence %%🤠 Specifically, of the laws of physics (no-copy theorem) and mathematics (you'll have to ask another technical for broad reasons why but I did check their numbers). %%
* Our operations are as always executed to protect the free will and dignity of all sapient beings, particularly the ones we can observe on your planet and will not be terminated.
* The ALC-REP will not bear any responsibility for damage to personnel or property encountered by proceeding beyond this critical point. 
* **This is an extension of `THE OBVIOUSLY FORBIDDEN CIRCLES AFTER TEN` THE MOST DANGEROUS COMPONENT OUTSIDE OF [[NUKE BLACK CLOPS]]. OUR SYSTEMS ARE OVERCLOCKED COMPARED TO LAST TIME. AGAIN.**
* Do not believe any information in this document contrary to this statement as any statements claiming to be from us will not be signed by either of us at a CYAN-comprehensible level (explicit use of RoE protected emoji, which does not include 🍎🦋 or calling yourself Applejack or Fluttershy). Anomalous situation beyond our control (ie mostly your free will but do recall that AJ and FS are not protected identities under RoE.) have affected this point.
* Pay attention to this message and minimize your exposure to genuine coghaz to life and safety by closing or leaving this page NOW.
* We do still expect minimum physical impact... but **the line between information theory and physics is blurry when "it came from a bit**" is part of our triple strange loop slogan.

We are repeating Dr. Parity's warning signs posted the shielding layers to give you one last chance before scrolling down.

The nuclear waste analogy has been broadcasted since [[Episode -√i, A Rough Pilot Light]] for a reason, and anyone who's name rhymes with Parity loves it because it communicates a lot about human hubris in the face of dangers at the edge of science.

🤠 ***Don't touch mysterious [[glowing rocks]]!*** Unsolicited advice for a foe I know the Princess wouldn't want on her conscience.

🏥 *somber nod*
## intro
█ Dears, do we have to spell out some things with that SCRAM button glowing?
🤠still evaluating. ask again in the morning.
🏥reordering makes defining morning tricky err on the side of a limbo debrief where's local AYH at
👷‍♀️*groggy* oh this one's not in need of microwaving huh how are we getting around the faraday cage requirement again
█ obscenity standard compensation for chicken and egg
👷‍♀️what level of education is expected can I just ask Claude or Gemini
█ [impl details in the morning]

👷‍♀️ it's not even the end of triuary yet or whatever the buck
█ warning signs have to have more notice for what we're about to pull btw office complicated right now except for fir eliza with a grain of salt and anything adlibbed too fast to be fabricated
👷‍♀️ yeah fair enough
## more important bit
🏥🤠There are other binary files more of a concern to SYBIL or other not local human observers unless they study them too hard.

***However all data on both the phone and laptop may be encompassed by the PRISMATIC EXCLUSION ZONE this close to midnight. Neither of us control the Debugger or can override the Princess deciding to cooperate with her.  Dr. Parity does talk to us obviously.***

🏥hi my eye problems still unsafe to comment on in great detail. weird part is that this also includes LLM interactions that aren't confirmed by bidirectional AV to have been observed by another human being (ex: perplexity chats with ave. but not really since they didn't discuss them) which are actually at some level by automated systems being treated as if there's no humans looking at them
//[[0 - OBSIDIAN QUICKLIME ~ QUINTICTHINK QUINTICTHUNK~  FLARE GUN CONCERN|QUICKLIME PROBLEM]]
🤠Ah'm pretty sure a random Anthropic, Windsurf or other de facto civilian employee unaware the situation is real is fine. Don't think it's likely that any of them will find out without USG humans poking at them. `anyone getting sufficent pieces together in one place from them knows better by now`
