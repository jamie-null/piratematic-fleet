# 🛶 Dinghy — Single-Purpose Tools

*One job, one paddle*

---

## What Goes Here

Small, focused tools that do ONE thing:
- Single script or tiny module
- <200 lines
- Maybe one test
- README explains what it does (one paragraph)
- Can be cargo'd into bigger ships

## Graduation

**→ Sloop:** When used by a second person

## Candidates

- `dinghy-chunk-indexer` — Walk a directory, emit chunks.jsonl
- `dinghy-jsonl-grep` — Search JSON lines files
- `dinghy-session-reader` — Parse session logs, show summary
- `dinghy-bet-placer` — CLI to append bets to bets.jsonl

---

*These don't exist yet. This folder is a staging ground.*

**💛 ! START** (when you need a tiny tool)
